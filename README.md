unit root testing
This is a R markdown file that explains the reason why a unit root testing is needed for time series. The theory was based on the paper Distribution of the Estimators for Autoregressive Time Series With a Unit Root by Dickey and Fuller.  The goal of this project was to explain the reason why unit root testing is needed and derive all the testing statistic used for the testing. We wrote a blog in R markdown file and proved our theory through simulation study as well as real data.
